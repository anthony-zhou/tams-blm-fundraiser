        <p class="big-quote">“If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.”
        </p>



        <p>During the past few weeks, the streets of the U.S. and various countries throughout the world have been
            filled with tired protestors. People who are tired of injustice. People who are tired of another hashtag.
            Another video. Another black person murdered by the people who vowed to protect them. </p>
        <p>NO MORE.</p>
        <p>We all have a responsibility to pour into and uplift people in the black community, especially during these
            painful times. </p>
        <p>With that being said, the Black Student Union and 18 other clubs at the Texas Academy of Mathematics and
            Science have decided to host a raffle to raise money for various organizations that focus on investing in
            African-Americans and their communities. View clubs, organizations, and prizes <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YGohSjtdaqrwj5oDrLwrzW2u10tOxsy54FL3XRx2KYM/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a></p>

            <p>*100% of proceeds will be donated to the respective organization.*</p>
